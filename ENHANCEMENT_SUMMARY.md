```

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### **Before Enhancement:**

- Basic text extraction
- Simple summarization
- No document type awareness

### **After Enhancement:**

- ‚úÖ **Document Type Identification**: "Medical Imaging Report (MRI)"
- ‚úÖ **Professional Terminology**: Clinical terms and healthcare language
- ‚úÖ **Structured Summaries**: Organized bullet points with key findings
- ‚úÖ **Context-Aware Analysis**: Tailored to document type and medical context
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**: Type detection, patient info, and analysis details

## üè• Example Output

For an MRI report, users now get:

**Document Type**: Medical Imaging Report (MRI)
**Summary**:
‚Ä¢ Document Type: MRI Report - Lumbar spine comprehensive evaluation
‚Ä¢ Patient: John Doe, age 43, presenting with chronic lower back pain
‚Ä¢ Key Clinical Findings: L4-L5 disc herniation with posterior central protrusion
‚Ä¢ Neurological Impact: Mild compression of traversing nerve roots
‚Ä¢ Clinical Correlation: Findings consistent with patient's radicular symptoms
‚Ä¢ Professional Recommendation: Conservative management with follow-up imaging

## üöÄ Ready for Production
